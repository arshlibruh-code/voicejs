# ðŸŽµ VoiceJS - Audio Visualization Exploration

My exploration of visualizing audio through interactive web experiences.

## ðŸŽ¨ What's Inside

**30+ Audio Visualizations** including:
- **Creative Visuals**: Orb, Waveform, Particles, Hexagon Grid
- **Mathematical Patterns**: Lissajous Curves, Rose Curves, Phyllotaxis
- **Professional Tools**: Oscilloscope, FFT Analyzer, Spectrogram, Phase Scope
- **3D Experiences**: Terrain, Sonogram, Beat Detection
- **Frequency Analysis**: Bass/Mid/Treble Spectrums, EQ Analyzer

## ðŸŽ¬ Demo

Check out the demo GIF showing the visualizations in action:

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Allow microphone access
3. Watch your audio come to life across all visualizations

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

- **Web Audio API** for real-time audio analysis
- **Canvas 2D** for most visualizations  
- **Three.js** for 3D experiences
- **Modular ES6** architecture
- **Responsive design** that works on any screen

Each visualization reacts to your audio in real-time, creating a unique visual experience based on frequency, amplitude, and rhythm.
